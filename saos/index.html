 <p>A customized secure android OS derivative, for your mobile phone.</p>
</header>
<main>
<h2>Why ?</h2>
<p>Increasingly sophisticated hackers and their escalating cyber-attacks are the only constant companion in our digital lives.</p>
<p>Our mobile phones, even when in our physical possession, continuously expose sensitive information to known/unknown parties over the internet.</p>
<p>A typical smart-phone (Android or iOS), contains 100s of background services deeply integrated into the operating system, invisible to the user, that share device/user meta-information on 24/7 basis with various organizations.</p>
<p>Most users have a false sense of security - with the use of encrypted apps. They trade convenience for privacy, and blindly believe the claims of the smartphone vendors; without reading the fine-print !</p>
<p>In other words, the smart-phone provides zero protection for <em>your</em> data.</p>
<h2>So, How do we protect our-selves ?</h2>
<h3>trust nothing, <em>verify</em> everything.</h3>
<p>Open Source software, enables us to do this.</p>
<p>All android phones are derivatives of ASOP (Android Open Source Project) - enabling anybody, who has the skills and time, to select only the components needed to create a customized distribution for a specific purpose.</p>
<h2>Introducing <em>our</em> Secret SAOS:</h2>
<p>Secret SAOS is a secure Android OS derivative, compatible with android apps, focused on keeping your online activities and data private.</p>
<p>Mobile phones with Secret SAOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>contains only the apps the users need, and nothing else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>communicates only with white-listed end-points, and nothing else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verified Boot:</p>
<p>Only signed software with custom keys will run on device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>De-googled Android:</p>
<p>No Google Mobile/Play Services. Prevents invisible uploads of meta-information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero app installs:</p>
<p>Once the custom OS is flashed onto the device, no other software can be installed/run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full Disc Encryption</p>
<p>Prevents data extraction from physical device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-PIN Protection</p>
<p>One PIN for normal usage.</p>
<p>One PIN for data-wipe usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Phone-calls/SMS</p>
<p>SIM cards are used only for internet-connection (4G)</p>
<p>All communication is via. trusted secure messaging apps.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How secure is the Secret SAOS ?</p>
<p>All data is encrypted, using on-device keys, and obfuscated to unauthorized users.</p>
<p>Multiple layers of software sandboxing ensures that un-authorized users cannot get into the device, and even if they do - cannot read/access any user data.</p>
<p>Each application is restricted to access the data that is generated by the user using that specific app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will SAOS work with all android phones ?</p>
<p>No, It will only work with android phones that support Android Verified Boot 2.0. Currently, Google Pixel series 4 and above are supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What apps are available for SAOS ?</p>
<p>Any android app that does not depend upon Google Play Services should work.</p>
<p>Our suggested apps are Signal/WhatsApp for messaging, and Brave/DuckduckGo for private browsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do software installs/updates work ?</p>
<p>Every phone receives a customized ROM signed by custom keys that are valid only for that device. These keys are stored offline. Hence all software updates will be done offline on secure systems that build, sign and provide OTA updates for the devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are all parts of the OS trusted/verified ?</p>
<p>Device drivers and firmware are provided in a binary form by SoC vendors, such as qualcomm, samsung, mediatek. These pieces of software enable hardware functionality such as graphics, lte, wifi, bluetooth, etc.</p>
<p>While in an ideal world, all components of the software are open source, enabling us to verify their functionality before allowing them to execute on our hardware.</p>
<p>Until governments pass laws and issue directives to these large corporations to release their software as open-source; we will need to deal with untrusted code.</p>
<p>We ensure that such binary blobs are sandboxed and restrict its use to interacting with the designated hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens when I am forced to part with my device ?</p>
<p>Our Multi-PIN functionality enables users to set a specific PIN that wipes out all user-data in the device. This way the device will open, but will not contain any user data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you update the OS ?</p>
<p>Since we work with ASOP - our OS updates are in sync with their stable branches, and are usually a few weeks after their code commits.</p>
<p>Security updates are done on an as needed basis. All security threats are not equal and applicable under all circumstances. Our layered sandbox approach provides a safe environment that proactively prevents such threats.</p>
<p>Our continuous involvement with the infosec community; enables us to become aware of threats before they become generally known. We evaluate the risks and choose effective techniques to counter such threats. We then publish OS updates via. our secure servers.</p>
